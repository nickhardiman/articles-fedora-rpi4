The CLI tool for working with libvirt is called https://libvirt.org/manpages/virsh.html[virsh].

== engine 

* virsh 
* libvirtd 
* qemu


The virsh command is part of the ``libvirt-client`` package. 
This package is part of the _virtualization_ DNF group.

== resources 

The virsh tool helps manage these resources. 

* Domain resources include machine emulation, what storage is attached, 
* Network resources include bridges, IP address pools, gateways.
* Storage pools are locations where disk images, installer ISOs are stored. 

There are some resources already created in the directory /var/lib/libvirt/.
For instance, there is an _images_ directory for storing disk images, but it's empty. 
And there is no config yet to tell libvirt to use this location. 

== configuration 

Libvirt configuration lives in the directory /etc/libvirt/. 
There are many files here ending in _.conf_ which define how the executables behave. 

Libvirt defines resources using XML. 
A fresh install only has a couple XML files, like /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/default.xml.
This file contains a definition for the default network.

Configuration is added using virsh, not by editing these XML files.

== the virsh command 

use _virsh_ to display the https://libvirt.org/news.html[version] of libvirt.  

[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ virsh version

Using library: libvirt 6.6.0
Using API: QEMU 6.6.0
Running hypervisor: QEMU 5.1.0

== view networks with virsh 

Configuration files in /etc/libvirt/ can only be read by root. 

Using your own account shows nothing. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ virsh net-list --all
 Name   State   Autostart   Persistent
----------------------------------------

[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
....

Using the root account shows something. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ sudo virsh net-list --all
 Name      State    Autostart   Persistent
--------------------------------------------
 default   active   yes         yes

[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
....


== list virtual machines 

List all virtual machines. 
There are no machines defined, so virsh displays an empty table.

[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ sudo virsh list --all
 Id   Name   State
--------------------

[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

== list storage pools 

There are no storage pools either. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@rpi4 images]# sudo virsh pool-list --all
 Name   State   Autostart
---------------------------

[root@rpi4 images]# 
----


???
sudo virsh net-dumpxml default
