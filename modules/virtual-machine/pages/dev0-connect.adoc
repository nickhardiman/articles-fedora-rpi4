There is no way of connecting to dev0 from your workstation. 
You can SSH from host1, or use the console. 


== connect using the console

Connect to the console with the ``virsh console`` command.
Hit the Enter key kbd:[‚èé]  to get the _login_ prompt to appear. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@rpi4 libvirt]# virsh console dev0.home
Connected to domain 'dev0.home'
Escape character is ^] (Ctrl + ])

dev0 login: 
----

Log in on the console with the password defined when making the volume.

== get the IP address 

The new VM asks the home DHCP server for an IP address. 

One way of finding out what IP address it gets is to check the DHCP leases.
This usually means figuring out how to query the home router. 
The IP address might be listed somewhere in the web UI of the home router.

Another way is to list the IP addresses the VM's OS knows about. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@dev0 ~]# ip -brief addr
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128

[root@dev0 ~]#

== disconnect from the console 

That's enough to prove the virtual machine is working OK. 

Disconnect from the console. 
The disconnection command is 
kbd:[Ctrl + ++]++ ] 


[source,shell]

[root@host1 ~]#

== try to connect from the workstation

You can't use SSH (Secure SHell) to connect from your workstation to your new RHEL machine.
The only account on this machine is root, but trying to connect with the password does not work.
This failure not because of spelling errors. 
It's because of SSH daemon config. 
The root user is not allowed to connect remotely like this. 
You don't get a message saying you aren't allowed.
Instead, you get three tries then a _permission denied_ message.
