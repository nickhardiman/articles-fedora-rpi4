??? I got rid of dnsmasq by defining bridge then libvirt network.  

The first time virt services run, they set up new things. 


== the DHCP and DNS service dnsmasq

dnsmasq handles some infrastructure services for the virtual network. 

[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ ps -C dnsmasq
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   1224 ?        00:00:00 dnsmasq
   1225 ?        00:00:00 dnsmasq
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----


.VMs use dnsmasq services

RHEL includes a complete system for managing VMs (virtual machines) - the KVM hypervisor, QEMU machine emulator and libvirt tools. 
The libvirt daemon uses http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html[dnsmasq] to provide 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP] 
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System[DNS] services. 
This article configures dnsmasq to set a fixed IPv4 address and domain name for our new guest VM.  

People remember names better than numbers. A fixed IP address is easier to use than a random IP address, and a DNS name is easier still.  
Out of the box, dnsmasq reads names and addresses from the /etc/hosts file. 
Add _guest2.private.example.com_ to two places. 

* the host's /etc/hosts file, so the host can look up the guest's name
* the host's dnsmasq configuration, so guests can look up the name


== libvirt runs the service, not systemd

Usually _systemd_ is in charge of running services, but not here. 
The _libvirtd_ daemon controls _dnsmasq_ services, not systemd. 
Running the command ``systemctl status dnsmasq`` says dnsmasq isn't running. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]# systemctl status dnsmasq
‚óè dnsmasq.service - DNS caching server.
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead)
[nick@host1 ~]# 
....


== dnsmasq processes 

One pair of processes - a parent and child - are started for each libvirt network that needs DHCP.
The _public0_ network doesn't use dnsmasq.
The _default_ and _private0_ networks do.

You can see these in a process list. 
The list has four entries for the executable /usr/sbin/dnsmasq. 
The list doesn't give any hints about which processes are for which networks. 

[source,shell]
....
[nick@host1 ~]# ps -fwwC dnsmasq
