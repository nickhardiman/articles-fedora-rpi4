== architecture

The virtual machine is built from virtual hardware. 
There are a few popular machine architectures. 
Fedora uses QEMU's upstream machine architectures, like "pc" for an Intel-based machine, "q35" for an older Intel machine (it's named after an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_chipsets#Core_2_chipsets[Intel chipset]), and "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64[aarch64]" for the Raspberry Pi and other 64-bit ARM machines.
