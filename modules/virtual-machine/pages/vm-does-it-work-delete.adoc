= delete the test VM

The _does-it-work_ VM is short-lived - it's created, checked, then deleted.


== stop the VM

Usually we stop a VM with the command ``virsh shutdown guest1``. 
This is a graceful shutdown, like running ``systemctl poweroff``.

But here we want to pull the plug, using ``virsh destroy guest1``.
Despite the dramatic _destroy_ name, this does not delete anything. 

[source,shell]
----
[root@rpi4 images]# virsh destroy does-it-work
Domain does-it-work destroyed

[root@rpi4 images]# 
----


== delete the VM

There are two resources to get rid of - the compute part and the storage part. 

Delete the new VM with the command  ``virsh undefine``.

[source,shell]
----
[root@rpi4 images]# virsh undefine --nvram does-it-work 
Domain does-it-work has been undefined

[root@rpi4 images]# 
----

Check it's gone. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@rpi4 images]# virsh list --all
 Id   Name   State
--------------------

[root@rpi4 images]# 
....

Remove the image file. 

[source,shell]
....
[root@rpi4 libvirt]# virsh vol-list images
 Name                                Path
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 does-it-work.raw                    /var/lib/libvirt/images/does-it-work.raw
 Fedora-Minimal-33-1.3.aarch64.raw   /var/lib/libvirt/images/Fedora-Minimal-33-1.3.aarch64.raw

[root@rpi4 libvirt]# 
[root@rpi4 libvirt]# virsh vol-delete does-it-work.raw --pool images
Vol does-it-work.raw deleted

[root@rpi4 libvirt]#
