== log in

Use the root account to log in. 

[source,shell]
----
rpi4 login: root
Password:
[root@rpi4 ~]# _
----



== power off

Use the CLI.  

[source,shell]
----
systemctl poweroff
----

Systemd messages flash by on the console, then it goes dark. 
The LED on the Pi stays on. 
Since a Pi does not come with an on-off switch, the Pi has to be disconnected from power before it can be turned on again. 

Switch off at the wall, or remove the transformer plug (AKA USB power brick).
