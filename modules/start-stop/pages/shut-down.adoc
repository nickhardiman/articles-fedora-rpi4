Shut down (or power down, or power off) the Pi.

Don't turn off the power while the computer is running. 
Some data that should be written to disk is stored in memory. 
Some services need to clean up files before they stop. 


If using the CLI, enter the command `sudo systemctl poweroff`.
If using Gnome, click the ‚èª menu option. 


Wait a few seconds. The screen goes dark and the activity LED on the board stops flashing.

Switch off the power.
