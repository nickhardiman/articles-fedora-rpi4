Unplug the keyboard and mouse.

If everything goes well, we won't use the console again. 
It's only useful for troubleshooting. 

After unplugging, the Pi runs in headless mode. 

Switch off the screen. 

== check your work

Use SSH to connect to the machine. 

Power off. 

Power on. 

Wait a minute. 
It's difficult to tell how long to wait, because there is no way of telling when the boot process is complete. 

Connect from your workstation using SSH.

The boot process did not hang when it did not find a keyboard, mouse or display screen.
