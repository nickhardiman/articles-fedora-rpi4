The web console provides a way of managing the OS through a web browser.

[source,shell]
----
Web console: https://rpi4:9090/ or https://192.168.1.2:9090/
----

The application that makes this work is https://cockpit-project.org/running[Cockpit]. 
Cockpit is an interactive Linux server admin interface.
It is already running, and the firewall allows traffic.

== log in to the web console 

Open in a web browser. 

Accept the danger of a self-signed certificate. 
The login page appears.

Use your new user account to log in. 
The dashboard appears.

Cockpit is running in a limited access mode. 
Some things, like the Reboot and Shutdown menu, are not displayed. 


== power off

Use the CLI.  

[source,shell]
----
systemctl poweroff
----

Systemd messages flash by on the console, then it goes dark. 
The LED on the Pi stays on. 
Since a Pi does not come with an on-off switch, the Pi has to be disconnected from power before it can be turned on again. 

Switch off at the wall, or remove the transformer plug (AKA USB power brick). 


== microdnf (Pi3, why here?)

DNF 3 is too big for a 1GB Raspberry Pi. 
Install microdnf. 

[source,shell]
----
sudo -i
dnf install microdnf
----

Update hundreds of packages.

[source,shell]
----
microdnf update
----

Turn off.

[source,shell]
----
systemctl poweroff
----
