== interactive shell vs. non-interactive shell 

An https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Interactive-Shells[interactive shell] is connected to a user terminal - it reads from the keyboard and writes to the screen. 

The shell knows whether it is interactive.
It behaves differently frorm a non-interactive shell. 
To see the interactiive option, use the variable *$-* to display a list of shell options.
The option _i_ means interactive.
If you want to know what the other letters mean, run _man bash_ and look for _set_ in the _BASH BUILTIN COMMANDS_ section.

---- 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ echo $-
himBHs
[nick@rpi4 ~]$

Also, if it's got a prompt, it's an interactive shell.
