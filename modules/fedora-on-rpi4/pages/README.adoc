[NOTE]
====
Most of these are not written yet, let alone published.
What would you like to read? 
All feedback is welcome. 

The files here are my attempt to document what is bundled with the free developer subscription, 
and how to use it.
The docs cover activities like these. 

File content is https://asciidoctor.org/[ASCIIDoctor] markdown.
Some diagrams created with http://asciiflow.com/[asciiflow] and converted to SVG files by https://github.com/asciitosvg/asciitosvg[asciitosvg].

I'd like to write more Fedora step-by-step articles like 
https://fedoramagazine.org/create-a-wifi-hotspot-with-raspberry-pi-3-and-fedora/[this one I wrote for Fedora Magazine].
Only this time I'd like to use my new toy, an RPi4.
