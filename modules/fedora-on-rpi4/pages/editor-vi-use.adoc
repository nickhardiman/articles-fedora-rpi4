Use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi[vi] text editor to change a file. 

It's not everyone's favourite, and there are many alternative editors. 
But vi is installed by default in Fedora.
You can rely on it being available, so it is worth climbing vi's learning curve.
Coping with vi's modes, single character commands and buffers is as difficult as getting to grips with the command line.
