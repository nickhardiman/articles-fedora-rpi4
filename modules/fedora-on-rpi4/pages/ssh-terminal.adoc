The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal[computer terminal] you use to communicate with the Raspberry Pi is the new software equivalent of an old piece of hardware.

Over many decades, many terminals were sold with many unique selling points. 
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo[terminfo] database was created to keep track of what each terminal could do. 

Physical terminals have been largely replaced by workstations running software terminals.
A software terminal emulates what a physical terminal could do. 

The terminal type used by the Raspberry Pi is stored in the environment variable TERM.

[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ echo $TERM
xterm-256color
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

Using SSH to connect to the Pi starts an eumlator called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm[xterm]. 
There are many other emulator programs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terminal_emulators[terminal emulators]. 
Opening a terminal in the Gnome desktop starts the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal[Gnome terminal]. 

== the terminfo database

Configuration is stored in files like this. 
This is not plain text and can't be displayed.
Tput can read it and translate the settings to something readable. 


[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ file /usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color
/usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color: Compiled 32-bit terminfo entry "xterm-256color"
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

This file contains a mystifying list of capabilities and key sequences. 
The infocmp command can display all these, but the list can only be read by terminal wizards. 

[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ infocmp $TERM
#	Reconstructed via infocmp from file: /usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256colo
xterm-256color|xterm with 256 colors,

	colors#0x100, cols#80, it#8, lines#24, pairs#0x10000,

	u8=\E[?%[;0123456789]c, u9=\E[c, vpa=\E[%i%p1%dd,
[nick@rpi4 ~]$

These capabilities were https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xcurses/terminfo.html[standardized back in the days of UNIX], and can be pretty obscure. 

* am is a boolean, and stands for automatic margins
* colors is a string, and sets the maximum number of colors on the screen. 
* vpa is a key, which sets the vertical position to absolute #1.



== read settings with tput 

The tput command can read the terminfo database and change settings.

Read the terminal descrption and display it.

[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ tput longname
xterm with 256 colors[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

Find out how many lines high and how many columns across your terminal is. 

[source,shell]
----
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ tput lines
30
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ echo "Rows=$(tput lines) Cols=$(tput cols)"
Rows=30 Cols=80
[nick@rpi4 ~]$ 
----

For more examples, run `man tput` and look for the EXAMPLES section.


== write settings with tput 

Some programs run commands like these for fancy text effects.

* turn on underline: tput smul
* turn off underline: tput rmul
* make the foreground (text) green: tput setaf 2
* make the foreground black: tput setaf 0
