One of the USB drives provides the OS storage. 
The other one holds installer software. 
All the installer software is in an ISO file. 
An ISO file is a copy of a file system from an optical disk, like a DVD.
If you're wondering where the name came from, ISO is an abbreviation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660[ISO 9660], which is an abbreviation of International Standards Organization file system standard number 9660.

Prepare the installer drive by copying the installer DVD file to it. 
First, download this DVD file from Fedora's web site. 

Use a linux workstation to copy the ISO to the USB drive. 
It's a simple copy using the `dd` command. 
The MacBook OS has the dd command too, although some options are different. 

In my example setup, the two USB drives look exactly the same. 
I labelled one "Fedora ISO" by cutting out a tag and tying it to the installer USB drive. 


== download Fedora Server

* Open Fedora's https://alt.fedoraproject.org/alt/[alternate architecture images] page. This page lists files for ARM aarch64, IBM Power and IBM s390x architectures. 
* Find the Fedora Server DVD download link (not the netinstall or raw image) in the ARM aarch64 section. 
* Download the latest server image. It's about 3GB and named something like _Fedora-Server-dvd-aarch64-34-1.2.iso_.

== Prepare Installer Drive 

Now plug the installer drive into the host computer. As with the target drive, ensure that any existing partitions are unmounted before continuing.

To set up the installer, do a direct write from ISO to drive.

[WARNING]
====
As with partitioning the target drive, this example command will copy directly to `/dev/sdb`. This command must be updated to reflect your system layout and to point to the correct drive; otherwise, data loss may occur on the host computer.

Once the write has completed, remove the drive from the host computer and plug it into the second blue USB 3.0 port of the unpowered Raspberry Pi 4.
