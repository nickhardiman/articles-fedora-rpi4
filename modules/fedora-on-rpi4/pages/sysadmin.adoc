Carry out the first system administration tasks.
Actually, the first sysadmin tasks were setting up the hardware and installing Fedora. 
These are the first sysadmin tasks on your fully operational system. 


== update software

This image file is not updated very often, so some packages get out of date.   
Dozens of packages can be upgraded.

* Update packages with `dnf update`.  
* Reboot the machine with `systemctl reboot`.

Over the years, a lot of people have put a lot of work into making the Raspberry Pi devices work. 
Use the latest software to make sure you get the benefit of their hard work. 
If you skip this step, you may find some things just donâ€™t work.

The update downloads and installs about a hundred packages. Since the storage is a micro-SD card, writing new software is a slow process. This is what using computing storage felt like in the 1990s.


== start customizing the system

There are a few other things to be set up at this point.

The _hostname_ command shows the full name is _localhost.localdomain_.

[source,shell]
----
[root@localhost ~]# hostname
localhost.localdomain
[root@localhost ~]# 
----

Replace the _localhost_ hostname with the command `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname host1.lab.example.com`. 
The prompt doesn't change until you start another shell. 

* Start another shell with the command 'exec bash'. Now the prompt looks like _[root@host1 ~]#_.
* Find the IP address with `ip addr`.
* Try an SSH login from your workstation.
* Power down with `systemctl poweroff`.
