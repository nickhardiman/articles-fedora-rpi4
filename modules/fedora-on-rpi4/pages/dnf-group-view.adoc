A DNF group is a collection of RPM packages. 

Some packages are useful to install together, even though they don't depend on each other to work. 
A DNF group defines a useful collection of packages.

A DNF group is not related to package dependencies. 
Installing one RPM package often means installing more than one package - the one you want and other packages required to make it work. 


== a DNF group 

Fedora has dozens of DNF groups, to help with system administration, office work and container development. 
The https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:SIGs[Fedora SIGs (Special Interest Groups)] often produce their own groups, like the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/3DPrinting[3D Printing] group. 

The DNF group "System Tools" lists packages for working with network connections, interfaces, storage and more. 

Groups are listed under four headings. 

* Available Environment Groups
* Installed Environment Groups
* Installed Groups
* Available Groups


== an environment group 

An environment group is used to create a Fedora Spin.
An environment group is created for use by the Anaconda installer rather than end-users, although an end-user can use use these groups. 
An environment group contains many groups. 


=== a Fedora Spin 

A https://spins.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora spin] is a themed version of Fedora.
That usually means Fedora combined with one desktop system. 
There are many desktop spins, including the https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/kde/[KDE Plasma spin], and https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/kde/[Xfce spin].
A spin can also be Fedora combined with productivity tools.
https://labs.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Labs] provide an https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/astronomy/[Astronomy spin], a https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/games/[Games spin], a https://labs.fedoraproject.org/en/scientific/[Scientific spin] and others.
