The RPi4 has its own firmware program, stored in flash.
This built-in firmware runs when the board is powered up. 
The onboard firmware is the first in a chain of firmware programs that run. 
The firmware in flash is supplied by the Raspberry Pi foundation.
This firmware is not touched by Fedora. 

The next program in the chain is stored in a file named config.txt on the removable storage. 
Removable storage is usually an SD card, but here we use a USB drive. 
The config.txt program starts UEFI firmware, then UEFI starts GRUB.

GRUB is the last of the firmware programs. Grub runs the kernel, which is the first of the OS programs.
