[NOTE]
====
These docs have nothing to do with any https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/[official Fedora docs].
Fedora isn't even supported on the Raspberry Pi 4. 
====

Running Fedora on the Raspberry Pi 4 is not officially supported. 
Some things do work, thanks to years of coding, reverse engineering and hard toil by project maintainers and developers.  
Or at least, if you stand back and squint, some things look like they work. 

I'm in the process of experimenting with Fedora on an RPi4 in my home lab. 
I'm writing about my experiments here.
