== a new Raspberry Pi 4 for the home lab 

You need an RPi4 - yep, so far so obvious. Don't get the 1, 2 or 4GB versions, nor the Compute Module 4. 




== components for a Pi workstation 


You don't need optional Pi equipment like a fan, heatsink, or HAT. You do need a fair amount of other hardware, including these.
It's probably you have some or all of these already. 
If not, an example is below. 

A USB drive will provide the storage. This is where all the software is stored (except for a little firmware stored on the Pi). 

The Raspberry Pi 4 will provide the compute. 
This is the number-crunching power provided by the CPU and all the other chips.

* *cables*. Connect the Pi to the home network with an ethernet cable. An HDMI cable connects to a monitor. Mouse and keyboard come with USB cables. 
* *power supply*.
* Two *USB drives* for storage. One for the installer ISO and one for the running OS. 
* *keyboard*, *video monitor* and *mouse*. This hardware combination is so common it used to be abbreviated to KVM, until Kernel-based Virtual Machines came along and stole the acronym. 

Much of this hardware, like the monitor and keyboard, is only required to get started. 
When everything is set up, you can connect from another computer over the network to the Raspberry Pi and do everything you need on the CLI (Command Line Interface).

Hardware in the picture is screwed to a frame and put in a cardboard box. 
These are DIY products.
