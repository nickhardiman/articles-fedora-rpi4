Plug everything in.

Don't use an SD card. Software will be stored on the flash storage drive, not an SD card. 

Plug the keyboard and mouse into the black USB 2 sockets.
In the example setup, the mouse is plugged into a socket on the keyboard, and the keyboard plugs into the RPi. 

Plug the flash storage drive into a blue USB 3 port. 

Connect the HDMI monitor to the first HDMI socket. 
The example setup also has a USB connection between one of the RPi's black USB 2 sockets and the monitor. This provides power. 

Connect the ethernet socket to the home network. 

Plug in the power adapter. Don't turn it on - there is no OS to run yet.
