Plug everything in.

Don't use an SD card. Software will be stored on the flash storage drive, not an SD card. 

Plug the keyboard and mouse into the black USB 2 sockets.
In the example setup, the mouse is plugged into a socket on the keyboard, and the keyboard plugs into the RPi. 

Connect the HDMI monitor to the first HDMI socket. 
The example setup also has a USB connection between one of the RPi's black USB 2 sockets and the monitor. This provides power. 

Connect the ethernet socket to the home network. 
A network switch near the new machine makes this easier.

Plug in the power adapter. Don't turn it on - there is no OS to run yet. 

Don't plug in the USB drives yet. 
They come later.
