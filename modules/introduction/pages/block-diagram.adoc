== hardware and software

Everything that makes up a computer can be split into things you can touch and things you can't. 

Here's an analogy you can use for this split. 
Software runs inside hardware. 
This is fairly accurate - the hardware contains a lot of electric circuits, and the software is electricity in those circuits (don't mention magnetism, that makes things messy).

== virtual machine

A virtual machine is a copy of a physical machine. 
Despite being entirely software, it acts like a physical machine. 

The block diagram shows three VMs located entirely in user space. 
That's a simplification of where the software is. 
A collections of applications, code libraries and kernel devices make virtual machines work.
Some of this software runs in user space, and some in kernel space.

== container

A container is a small piece of user space. 
An application inside a container's small piece of user space can't use the resources in the main user space. 

A server may have containers but no guest VMs. 
Virtual machines are not required for containers.

Containers work with both physical machines and virtual machines. 
Each one has a user space.
