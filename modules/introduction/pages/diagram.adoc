== a summary diagram 

There is no good way of illustrating the many parts of hardware and software in a computer using a diagram. Electricians have wiring diagrams, which can be used for the electronics

== inside or on top

Software runs inside hardware, not on top of it. And some software runs inside other software, like applications in an operating system. That concept doesn't make for a good diagram, and it confuses people learning software. 


== analogies from other industries 

Two areas are a source of analogies to help explain what is going on in a computer. 

* a car analogy
* an office block analogy

A car is a complex man-made machine and so is a computer, so that's a good start for explaining a computer layout. There are other similarities: a large industry produces cars, and the same is true for computers. 


A building is created ground-up. The foundation is laid, some floors are stacked on top of this, and on top of the whole structure is a roof. 
A  analogy works 


== block diagram 

A block diagram is about relationships.

If you imagine an electric car as a block diagram, it looks nothing like a car. 
It does give a simple picture of what is inside the car.

== hardware block diagram

Hardware is developed as discrete components, then collected onto a board and attached by wires. 
Translating this layout into a block diagram works well. It doesn't describe very much, but it is a good starting point.

== software block diagram 

Block diagrams are also used for software. 
There are some clear boundaries in the land of software, such as between software components built by different manufacturers, between virtual machines, and between business applications.
But mapping business requirements onto software leads to complicated programs, which don't easily translate to block diagrams. 
This diagram shows part of Ansible Automation Platform. 
It's a great help to people who already understand the concepts.
It's a hindrance for everyone else.

The relationships betweeen components is also a mess. 
Software largely exists in the land of people's imagination, and it can get as messy as people can imagine. 

Software components are only discrete if programmers try hard to make them that way.
