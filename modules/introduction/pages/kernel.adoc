The firmware loads low-level device management software, then  BIOS starts GRUB, then GRUB starts the kernel.

== kernel 


Each kernel version has a few files. 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vmlinux[vmlinuz], the kernel.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk[initrd (initial ramdisk)]. This contains drivers and other files the kernel needs.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System.map[System.map], a look-up table that maps symbols to memory locations.
* config, the configuration file used to build the kernel. 

The kernel release name is rather long, like this. 4.18.0-193.6.3.el8_2.x86_64
