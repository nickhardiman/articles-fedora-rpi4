The plan 

* Obtain Raspberry Pi 4 parts.
* Set up a new Pi workstation on the home network. This provides a base hardware layer to build on. 
* Install software. Build up software layers on the hardware layer. 


This guide uses a https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB]. 
It's the only Pi board that all the software layers will fit on. 



[NOTE]

February 2023: Unfortunately, a https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB] board is very hard to get hold of.
