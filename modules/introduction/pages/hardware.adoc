There are many little hardware devices on this board.
Three main classes of device do work, store code and get things in and out of the machine: CPU, memory and I/O.
Each class contains many devices. 
A CPU contains devices that handle time, maths, registers and more.  
Memory devices get data in and out of the CPU.
I/O devices connect all kinds of things to the memory and CPU, from dead media like a parallel printer to UART for serial communication. 

A connection is made with a 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)[bus] and a device controller. 
A bus is the wires that connect two things together, plus a management unit that makes it work. 
A device controller is a chip that knows how to translate between bus and device.

== device controllers and busses

A computer system has more than one type of bus. 
Memory is connected with a internal high-speed system bus, and I/O devices are connected with an external low-speed USB (Universal Serial Bus). 
A 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller_(computing)[device controller] manage devices like ethernet, storage, video and audio.
