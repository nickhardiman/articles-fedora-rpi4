This guide packs a lot of software  onto a Raspberry Pi. 
This is a set of abstraction layers for keeping track of the work. 

This page describes a list of things. 
Each thing is a layer built on top of the the one underneath. 
It's based on a building trade analogy, described in this page. 
These eight layers match what you'd find in a large enterprise server. 


. virtual machine
.. guest application 
.. guest container
.. guest OS 
.. guest bootloader 
.. guest hardware and network
. physical machine
.. host hypervisor
.. host OS 
.. host firmware and bootloader
.. host hardware and network 



This layer model is useful for work described here. But a model that is as simple as this is not an accurate representation of reality. 
For instance, the OS may use a firmware interface to access hardware, or may go direct and skip the firmware layer.  



== abstraction layers

Abstraction is one of the four ways of computational thinking (the other three are pattern recognition, decomposition and algorithms). The layer below offers a bunch of shiny features to the layer above, so it can get stuff done. The layer below hides all the ugly work required to get stuff done. If you buy a tin of baked beans, you don't have to worry about how the beans ended up in there - most of the details are abstracted away. If you program an application, there's a lot of abstraction there too.  

=== start with two layers

Everything that makes up a computer can be split into things you can touch and things you can't. 

There are a couple analogies you can use for this split. 

One analogy says software runs inside hardware. This is fairly accurate - the hardware contains a lot of electric circuits, and the software is electricity in those circuits (don't mention magnetism, that makes things messy).

Another analogy compares a computer to the building trade. 
First you build the foundation (hardware), then you build the useful stuff on top (software). This has the advantage that it's useful to explain the idea of abstraction. The disadvantage of this analogy is it falls apart when you get into the details.

* software
* hardware 

This isn't some industry formal standard. 
It's a simple model of a computer, to make the work easier to understand. 

=== then three layers

A sysadmin may think of machines as having three layers, like this. 
The sysadmin's work connects the physical things in the data center to the applications that provide business value. 

* applications
* operating system
* hardware and network

Inside the OS layer are three main components.
These are components that work together, rather than layers that hide complexity.

* kernel
* command interpreter
* system utilities

This layered view isn't the only way to view the system, and it does not work for everyone. 
A developer who works on device drivers might prefer a model like this, showing firmware is the crucial interface between hardware and software. 

* software
* firmware
* hardware 


=== split the software layer in two

The software layer can be split into two - OS and application. 
The layer of applications is built on three lower layers. 

Domestic computers and small server computers often stick to these  layers. 

* application
* OS 
* firmware 
* hardware 

When servers got bigger and more powerful, some resources weren't getting used. 
The computers got too big for the applications. 


=== add a virtualization layer with a hypervisor

A hypervisor can split one large physical machine into many smaller virtual machines. 
A hypervisor is an application that manages virtual machines. 
It emulates computer hardware. 

A hypervisor virtually creates new computers in the software layer.
A real computer is called a physical machine and a computer emulated in software is called a _virtual machine_. 
The _virtual_ in virtual machine means each new computer is virtually the same as a physical computer, but not exactly the same.
An operating system and applications can be installed on a virtual computer in the same way they get installed on a physical computer. 

* virtual machine 
* physical machine

There are also the synonyms host and guest.

* guest machine 
* host machine

=== seven layers

Since virtualization adds another stack of layers, the full set now looks like this. 
(There is no virtual firmware. Firmware is a hardware/software interface thing.) 

* guest application 
* guest OS 
* guest hardware 
* host hypervisor
* host OS 
* host firmware
* host hardware 

Managing virtual machines takes a lot of work. 
There is more than one way to manage virtualization. 

== virtualization with a container

A kernel can create containers (virtual spaces) for applications to run in. 
These can be smaller and faster than virtual machines. 

A container is difficult to configure, and many containers are difficult to manage. 
The hard work is done by a container orchestration application. 

* application
* container
* OS 
* firmware
* hardware 

=== an enterprise server has eight layers

An enterprise server is the big truck of the computer world. 
One machine's resources can be divided and subdivided to accomodate many virtual machines and dozens of containers. 
An application running on a large server can be on top of all these layers. 

* guest application 
* guest container
* guest OS 
* guest hardware 
* host hypervisor
* host OS 
* host firmware
* host hardware 

Rearranging that list to split the physical and virtual layers looks like this. 

. virtual machine
.. guest application 
.. guest container
.. guest OS 
.. guest bootloader 
.. guest hardware and network
. physical machine
.. host hypervisor
.. host OS 
.. host firmware and bootloader
.. host hardware and network 

Enterprise servers don't all have these eight layers. 
FOr instance, a server may have containers but no guest VMs. 
Virtual machines are not required for containers. 
Containers work with both physical machines and virtual machines. 



== you are here <-

Some pages include this list, along with a kind of "you are here" pointer, like this.

. virtual machine
.. guest application 
.. guest container
.. guest OS 
.. guest bootloader 
.. guest hardware and network
. physical machine
.. host hypervisor
.. host OS 
.. host firmware and bootloader <- here
.. host hardware and network
