A computer can be split into these three layers. 
This is a simple model of a computer. 

* software
* firmware
* hardware 

This guide packs a lot of smaller layers into that software layer. 
This is the kind of layering you may find in a large enterprise server. 

* application
* container
* OS 
* virtual firmware
* virtual hardware 
* hypervisor application
* OS 
* firmware
* hardware 

== first, split the software layer in two. 

The software layer can be split into two - OS and application. 
The layer of applications is built on three lower layers. 

Domestic computers and small server computers often stick to these four layers. 

* application
* OS 
* firmware
* hardware 

When servers got bigger and more powerful, some resources weren't getting used. 
The computers got too big for the applications. 


== virtually duplicate layers with a hypervisor

A hypervisor can split one large physical machine into many smaller virtual machines. 
A hypervisor is an application that manages virtual machines. 
It emulates computer hardware. 

A hypervisor virtually creates new computers in the software layer.
A real computer is called a physical machine and a computer emulated in software is called a _virtual machine_. 
The _virtual_ in virtual machine means each new computer is virtually the same as a physical computer, but not exactly the same.
An operating system and applications can be installed on a virtual computer in the same way they get installed on a physical computer. 

* application 
* OS 
* virtual firmware
* virtual hardware 
* hypervisor application
* OS 
* firmware
* hardware 

Managing virtual machines takes a lot of work. 
There is more than one way to manage virtualization. 

== virtualization with a container

A kernel can create containers (virtual spaces) for applications to run in. 
These can be smaller and faster than virtual machines. 

A container is difficult to configure, and many containers are difficult to manage. 
The hard work is done by a container orchestration application. 

* application
* container
* OS 
* firmware
* hardware 

== layers in an enterprise server

Containers work with both physical machines and virtual machines. 
An application running on a large server can be on top of many layers. 

* application
* container
* OS 
* virtual firmware
* virtual hardware 
* hypervisor application
* OS 
* firmware
* hardware 

== inside the OS layer 


An OS is made of three main components. 
These are not layers. 

* kernel
* command interpreter
* system utilities
