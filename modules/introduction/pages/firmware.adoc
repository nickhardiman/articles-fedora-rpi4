https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware[Firmware] does all the work between power-on and OS starting.  
When you boot up a computer, obscure messages start to appear to the screen after a few seconds. These are messages from the UEFI application.

Firmware is software that controls hardware. 
If you want to know who's responsible for the "firmware" name and if he had a sense of humor, check out Ascher Opler's article in http://bitsavers.org/magazines/Datamation/196701.pdf[Datamation magazine, volume 13 number 1]. This magazine came out half a century ago, has groovy modern art on the cover and plenty of great hardware photos inside.  

The boot process is a chain of software. 
The Raspberry Pi bootloader starts the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface[UEFI] system, and the UEFI bootloader starts the kernel. 

The GNU project maintain their own boot loader, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB#Version_2_(GRUB_2)[GRUB2]. 
The GRUB2 bootloader is the Fedora UEFI application.


== firmware 2 

Boot loader firmware manages the computer start-up process, and device firmware initializes devices that make up the computer.
The start-up process is automatic, so there is no need for most people to understand what's happening. 

The boot loader firmware carries out many jobs, like these.

* runs the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test[POST (Power-on self-test)]
* trains memory
* searches for option ROMs (extra firmware included with some devices)
* displays a control panel
* finds devices that can boot an OS
* starts the next stage of booting

Firmware starts before many devices work, so it's not stored on a disk. Instead, some kind of non-volatile memory on the motherboard stores the first firmware program.


== firmware 3

Firmware has to get everything started. For instance, to boot up the OS, the firmware must first find the storage, finds the OS kernel on that storage, figure out how to use the memory, copy the kernel into that memory, and point the CPU at the first instruction in that kernel.
After that point, the kernel is up and running, and the OS can take over. 

Firmware is tied to the computer it runs on. 
It has to understand how to work with the many devices that make up a computer, and different types of computer have different collections of devices.
Even two closely related computers like the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Raspberry Pi 4 are different.
If you look at these two side by side, you can see the chips are different and the layout has changed. 
The way devices are connected on the Raspberry Pi has changed, too. 
Ethernet used to be connected to USB, and now it has its own controller. 
And USB now has its own PCIe controller on the SoC. 



== the boot process 

When the Raspberry Pi powers up, a chain of firmware programs run before Linux starts. 

. power on 
. boot ROM, on the SoC
. bootloader, in EEPROM on the SoC
. start4x.elf, in the first partition
. UEFI
. GRUB2
. Linux

=== power on 

=== boot ROM, on the SoC

A boot ROM starts first.
This is stored on the SoC (the BCM2711 chip).
It has two jobs - first it checks for bootloader updates, then it starts the bootloader. ROM is Read-Only Memory - you can't make any changes to this program. Since you can't change it, you can't break it and permanently brick your computer. 

=== bootloader, in EEPROM on the SoC

The bootloader program is also stored on the SoC, in an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM[EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-only Memory)]. That means this program can be updated, although you do have to jump through a few hoops. If someone talks about a firmware update, they may be talking about updating this bootloader code. 
The bootloader's job is to search for the next bootloader stage. 
Usually this means reading the SD card, finding the first partition, and running the code in the file _start4x.elf_. 


The bootloader can also search the network and USB storage. 

If you power on the Raspberry Pi without an SD card, then after a couple seconds a screenful of information appears, including _SD card not detected_ errors. 
These messages are printed by the bootloader. 

=== start4x.elf and fixup4.dat, in the first partition

This is firmware that starts the GPU. 
Graphics software may not seem relevant to the boot process, but that's the way the Pi is wired.  

On a running Fedora system, the first partition is mounted on /boot/efi/ so you can see _start4x.elf_ in that directory.

.bootloader firmware

[root@localhost ~]# file /boot/efi/start4x.elf 
/boot/efi/start4x.elf: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Broadcom VideoCore III, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
[root@localhost ~]#

=== UEFI 

The system loads the UEFI application, efi/fedora/grubaa64.efi.
UEFI displays a few lines on the screen, including "Found EFI removable media binary efi/fedora/grubaa64.efi".

UEFI is a https://www.uefi.org/specifications[set of specifications], not software. 
Software that is built to these specification is a UEFI system.
UEFI defines how to boot over the network (with PXE and TFTP), how secure boot should work, and where to find the OS boot loader.
A UEFI system is modular and extendable, so it's more like a small OS than an application. It even comes with its own shell. 

The OS needs to know about the clock, console, block storage, memory and all the other devices that make up a computer. 
The UEFI system presents that information in a standardized way - any OS that talks the UEFI language can get its hands on all that device data.

Linux can be built to do the job of UEFI - it can find all the hardware, initalize it and creating reference tables for how it all hangs together. 
But then there would be one version of Linux for the  Raspberry Pi 3 and another version the Raspberry Pi 4, with its changed hardware. 
Instead, the hardware work is handed over to the UEFI application.
The UEFI application for a Raspberry Pi 4 is different to the UEFI application on the RPi3. 

Usng a UEFI application means the same copy of Linux can run on both machines. 
In fact, the UEFI system presents all these devices in a standardised way, so any OS can get the information it needs to work. 
Mac OS X, Windows, Linux and BSD all work with UEFI.

=== GRUB2

The UEFI system starts GRUB2. 
It presents a menu of OS choices.
After a few seconds, it loads the default kernel and its RAMdisk from the /boot partition and runs it.
