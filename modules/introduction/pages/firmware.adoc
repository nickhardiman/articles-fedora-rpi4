= firmware

Software embedded in a piece of hardware is firmware. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware[Firmware] does all the work between power-on and OS starting.  

The simple view in our layer diagram is that everything that runs before the OS is running, like UEFI and the boot loader, is firmware. 
Seperating the firmware and OS in the real world is more complicated.

Firmware has to get everything started. For instance, to boot up the OS, the firmware must first find the storage, finds the OS kernel on that storage, figure out how to use the memory, copy the kernel into that memory, and point the CPU at the first instruction in that kernel.
After that point, the kernel is up and running, and the OS can take over. 


== firmware is hard to get at 

Firmware manages the computer start-up process, and device firmware initializes devices that make up the computer.
The start-up process is automatic, so there is no need for most people to understand what's happening. 

Most firmware is hidden. 
A CPU doesn't run it, it's hard to update, and invisible to users. 
But some firmware shows its presence. 
When you boot up a computer, obscure messages start to appear to the screen after a few seconds. These are messages from U-Boot, one of the firmware applications.


== open or closed source 

Usually, the organizations who build hardware components also write the firmware it uses. 
It's not open source software. 
These organizations view firmware as valuable intellectual property and don't want others knowing what is going on inside the firmware programs. 
Some https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_firmware[firmware is open source], like 
https://community.amd.com/t5/business/empowering-the-industry-with-open-system-firmware-amd-opensil/ba-p/599644[AMD openSIL] for AMD chips,  
https://www.coreboot.org/[coreboot] to load the OS and 
specifications from the https://openpowerfoundation.org/[OpenPOWER Foundation]. 


== where did that "firmware" name come from?

Firmware is software that controls hardware. 
If you want to know who's responsible for the "firmware" name and if he had a sense of humor, check out Ascher Opler's article "Fourth-Generation Software" in http://bitsavers.org/magazines/Datamation/196701.pdf[Datamation magazine, volume 13 number 1]. This magazine came out half a century ago, has groovy modern art on the cover,   great hardware photos inside, and fascinating facts from the sizzling sixties. 

The original definition of firmware covered the new type of software that was appearing in the industry in the 1960s, which ran before the 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit[CPU] 
started its 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle[fetch/decode/execute cycle]. 
This software added some flexibility to hardwired devices.
This simple boundary is long-gone, and now the CPU handles some firmware work. 


== from power-on to OS

The boot process is a chain of software. 
The Raspberry Pi bootloader starts the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface[UEFI] system, and the UEFI bootloader starts the kernel. 

Firmware carries out many jobs, like these.

* runs the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test[POST (Power-on self-test)]
* trains memory
* searches for option ROMs (extra firmware included with some devices)
* displays a control panel
* finds devices that can boot an OS
* starts the next stage of booting

Firmware starts before many devices work, so it's not stored on a disk. Instead, some kind of non-volatile memory on the motherboard stores the first firmware program.


== some firmware is device-specific

Some firmware is tied to the computer it runs on. 
It has to understand how to work with the many devices that make up a computer, and different types of computer have different collections of devices.

Even two closely related computers like the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Raspberry Pi 4 have different collections of devices.
If you look at these two side by side, you can see the chips are different and the layout has changed. 
The way devices are connected on the Raspberry Pi has changed, too. 
Ethernet used to be connected to USB, and now it has its own controller. 
And USB now has its own PCIe controller on the SoC.
